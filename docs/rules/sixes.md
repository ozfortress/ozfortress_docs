# Sixes Ruleset

## Format Specificity
Rules within this ruleset apply strictly to the Sixes format (6v6). While each ruleset may share rules, the specific contents are likely different when listed within a format-specific ruleset rather than the Global ruleset. Please note this ruleset is authored for our Sixes seasonal leagues, but in the event it is linked on an ozfortress-run Sixes tournament, rules mentioning seasonal specifics should be ignored. If you are not sure whether or not a rule applies to a Sixes tournament run by us, please reach out.

## 1. Sixes Format
### 1.1. Class Limits
The following class limits are required on for official matches. Breaking these limits in any way is considered cheating, and depending on administrator discretion could lead to league penalties or a match result being overturned.

#### 1.1.1. Core Class Limits
- 2 Scouts
- 2 Soldiers
- 1 Demoman
- 1 Medic

#### 1.1.2. Off Class Limits
- 1 Pyro
- 1 Heavy
- 1 Engineer
- 1 Sniper
- 1 Spy

#### 1.1.3. Mercenary Off Class Locking
It is reasonable to restrict mercenaries from playing particular core classes or Sniper; you may **not** restrict mercenaries from playing Pyro, Heavy, Engineer, or Spy. The only exception is restricting a mercenary to play Medic exclusively.

### 1.2. Whitelist (Unlocks)
The Sixes whitelist can be found [here](https://whitelist.tf/ozfortress_6v6).

### 1.3. Control Point (5CP)
#### 1.3.1. 5CP map timer
The map timer for 5CP maps is 25 minutes. 

#### 1.3.2. 5CP round timer
The round timer for 5CP maps is 4 minutes (through the usage of the [Progressive Ruleset Timer](/info/server_configs/#progressive-ruleset-timer-plugin)).

#### 1.3.3. Progressive Ruleset 5CP round win limit
ozfortress has adopted the Progressive Ruleset that creates a dynamic win condition for 5CP maps for all divisions. 

 1. If a team reaches a total of 5 rounds before the end of the map timer, they win the map.

 2. If, once the map timer runs out, neither team has reached a total of 5 rounds, the round win limit is set to the current highest round score + 1. The match continues until one team meets this new round win limit.
    - For example, if the score is currently 2-3, the round win limit is set at 4.

#### 1.3.5. 5CP map draws
Map draws are currently not possible due to the dynamic win condition described above.

### 1.4. King of the Hill (KOTH)
In Sixes, all King of the Hill (KOTH) maps follow a best of five win condition with a three minute team clock. Different KOTH maps may vary slightly on overtime timers, locked and unlocked timers (when the point is not able to be captured at the start and when it unlocks) as these are built into the map.

## 2. Sixes Playoffs
### 2.1. Playoff Match Format
Playoff matches are almost exclusively played as a best of three (BO3) series with maps selected from the map pool. Premier and High Grand Final matches are played as a best of five (BO5) series. 

#### 2.1.1. High Grand Finals
High teams are expected to play Grand Final matches as a best of five (BO5) series. However, two High teams can agree to play a best of three (BO3) series instead, but they do need to consult their division administrator before doing so.

#### 2.1.2. Premier & High Grand Final Scheduling
The Premier Grand Final match occurs on a predetermined date as communicated on the seasonal league page. The High Grand Final match does not occur on a predetermined date, however may not be scheduled on the same night as the Premier Grand Final.

### 2.2. Playoffs Bracket
The top four teams of the Regular Season participate in Page Playoffs as described [here](/rules/global/#261-page-playoffs).

### 2.3. Premier & High Regular Season Map Selection
For Premier and High seasonal matches following our two map format, there will be four maps to choose from. The **Home Team** is awarded the first map pick.

1. **Home Team bans** a map.
2. **Away Team bans** a map.
3. **Home Team picks** a map.
4. The remaining map is played.

Please note all other divisions will have their maps pre-selected for that round by league adminstrators prior to the season starting.

### 2.4. Playoff Map Selection
#### 2.4.1. BO3 Playoff Matches
For Playoff matches following a best of three (BO3) format, the **higher seeded team** is awarded a map pick advantage prior to bans.

**The higher seeded team** is **Team A**. They can, however, choose to be **Team B** by deferring the first ban. **Maps must be played in the order in which they were picked.**

1. **Team A bans** a map.
2. **Team B bans** a map.
3. **Team A picks** a map.
4. **Team B picks** a map.
5. **Team B bans** a map.
6. **Team A picks** a map.

| **Team A** | Ban |     | Pick |      | Ban |      |
|------------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|------|
| **Team B** |     | Ban |      | Pick |     | Pick |

#### 2.4.2. BO5 Playoff Matches
The Premier Grand Final and High Grand Final Playoff matches are a best of five (BO5) series where neither team is awarded an advantage. 

**The higher seeded team** is **Team A**. They can, however, choose to be **Team B** by deferring the first ban. **Maps must be played in the order in which they were picked.**

1. **Team A picks** a map.
2. **Team B picks** a map.
3. **Team A bans** a map.
4. **Team B bans** a map.
5. **Team A picks** a map.
6. **Team B picks** a map.
7. **Team A bans** a map.
8. **Team B bans** a map.
9. The remaining map is picked.

| **Team A** | Pick |      | Ban |     | Pick |      | Ban |     | Decider |
|------------|------|------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Team B** |      | Pick |     | Ban |      | Pick |     | Ban | Decider |
