# Global Ruleset
!!! failure "Disclaimer"
    **ozfortress is not affiliated with or sponsored by Valve Corporation.**

    **The sale of in-game ozfortress medals, as well as any other medals, is strictly prohibited.**
    
    **Valve maintains a strict policy that league and tournament runners should never sell/allow the sale of Medals/Promotional Items**, and this policy extends to players seeking to acquire such Medals/Promotional Items, whether through in-game currency, real money, or other means. Individuals or parties caught engaging in the sale or trade of these items will be reported directly to Valve.

    Selling a slot on an active roster for in-game items or money is also **strictly prohibited** by ozfortress. 

    ozfortress both does not condone, nor allow betting on ozfortress matches in any form. Failure to abide by this condition will result in serious penalties and/or legal action.

## 1. Global Ruleset
The purpose of this ruleset is to collate rule clauses that are typically used for all competitions and are considered by League Administration as universal. It is the responsibility of each player to be informed of the contents of the current ruleset. **Ignorance of clauses within this ruleset is not an excuse.**

### 1.1. Format Rulesets
Rules in this ruleset that don't mention Sixes or Highlander should be considered general competitive rules. Specific format rules, such as class limits, whitelists, map pools, and game mode rules (like 5CP for Sixes or Stopwatch for Highlander), are detailed in the [Sixes ruleset](/rules/sixes/) and the [Highlander ruleset](/rules/highlander/).

Failure to meet format rules, such as class limits and whitelists, may result in the following penalties:

|                  |    Player Penalty     |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |  One round match ban  | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
|   Second Offence | Three round match ban | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences |    One season ban     |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

### 1.2. Ruleset Changes
ozfortress reserves the right to modify its rulesets as deemed appropriate to uphold and maintain a spirit of overall fairness and good sportsmanship. Any changes will be clearly announced through a news post on the ozfortress front page.

### 1.3. Rulings
This ruleset serves as the guideline for which rulings are made by administrators. We understand that the ruleset may not cover every situation and, therefore, we may occasionally deliver judgement-based rulings. 

### 1.4. Penalties
Teams can receive minor, moderate, and major penalties when competing in ozfortress competitions. League Penalties are **seperate** to the Player Behaviour Infractions system. You can read more about League Penalties [here](/rules/penalties/).

#### 1.4.1. Player Penalties
Depending on the offence, individual players may also receive penalties. Unless otherwise stated, **instances of player offences carry across seasons**.

### 1.5. Admin Shopping
Seeking a different answer from other administrators after receiving a ruling is strictly prohibited and may result in punishment. Teams **are** allowed, however, to appeal a decision with a more senior admin (such as a format's head admin).

Instances of Admin Shopping may result in the following penalties:

|                  |    Player Penalty     |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |        Warning        |                 Warning                  |
|   Second Offence |  One round match ban  | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences | Three round match ban |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

### 1.6. Player Integrity
Players and teams participating in ozfortress competitions are expected to conduct themselves with integrity. Any attempt to deceive or mislead players, captains, or administrators is strictly prohibited.

Instances of misleading players, captains, or administrators may result in the following penalties:

|                  |    Player Penalty     |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |        Warning        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
|   Second Offence |  One round match ban  | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences | Three round match ban |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

### 1.7. Sportsmanship
Players and teams participating in ozfortress competitions are expected to maintain sportsmanship in all communications, with global chat allowing light and friendly banter. Discrimination based on factors such as race, nationality, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age is considered an extreme breach of sportsmanship, resulting in penalties determined by ozfortress administration or the Behaviour Panel.

In addition to any punishments determined by the Behaviour Panel, excessive toxicity during matches may result in the following penalties:

|                  |    Player Penalty     |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |        Warning        |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
|   Second Offence |  One round match ban  | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences | Three round match ban | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

### 1.8. Staff
Currently, four distinct teams of staff support ozfortress and its competitions. You can see our current and active staff for all areas of ozfortress on our [staff page](/info/staff/).

#### 1.8.1. League Administrators
For any competition-specific issues, team captains should contact League Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord). For all other issues, League Administrators can be contacted through the #admin-support channel in the ozfortress Discord.

#### 1.8.2. Anti-Cheat
All cheating-related matters should be reported to the Anti-Cheat team. You can read more about this process [here](/info/anticheat_and_you/), as well as in [12. Cheating, Exploits and Bans](/rules/global/#12-cheating-exploits-and-bans)

#### 1.8.3. Behaviour Panel
All behaviour matters, including those covered in [1.7. Sportsmanship](/rules/global/#17-sportsmanship), should be reported to the Behaviour Panel. You can read more about this process [here](/rules/infractions/).

#### 1.8.4. New Player Experience
The New Player Experience team exists with the sole focus of making it easier for new players to join the competitive scene.

#### 1.8.5. ozfortress Representation
Players not part of ozfortress staff who change their alias to contain the ozfortress tag with malicious intent may be infracted, outlined as impersonation [here](/rules/infractions/).

### 1.9. Staff as Players
Many members of ozfortress staff actively participate in our competitions. In both matches and scrims, we expect that players refrain from engaging with ozfortress staff beyond their roles as players. If players have any issues which need to be addressed, they are encouraged to seek support through the appropriate Discord channels.

Failing to adhere to this expectation will result in the following penalties:

|                  |   Player Penalty    |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       Warning       |                 Warning                  |
|   Second Offence |       Warning       |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
| Further Offences | One round match ban | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

## 2. Seasonal Leagues
### 2.1. Season Structure
ozfortress Seasonal Leagues typically run for a total of eight to ten weeks. First, a regular season is completed, followed by three weeks of playoffs.

### 2.2. Divisions
Seasonal leagues are divided into skill brackets, referred to as divisions. These divisions depend on the number of teams that sign up, the competition format, and the length of the competition. When applying to participate in competitions, teams nominate their preferred divisions. While efforts will be made to accommodate these preferences, the skill level of a team compared to others within the division may influence final division placements.

### 2.3. Map Pool
Each season features a pool of maps which are played in both regular season and playoff matches. You can find the map pool for a season on its seasonal league page.

### 2.3.1. Map Play Order
Maps must be played in top-to-bottom order as seen on that match's match page, for both regular season and playoff matches (including playoff matches without pick/bans). Teams are not permitted to change this order, even if both rosters agree.

### 2.4. Playable Match Days
Playable Match Days has been moved to [7.3. Match Organisation & Playable Match Days](/rules/global/?h=playable#73-match-organisation-playable-match-days).

### 2.5. Regular Season
Rounds within a regular season are completed at weekly intervals; teams compete in one match each week featuring two maps from the map pool. Regular seasons are typically run using Round-Robin, however, depending on signup numbers, the Swiss System may be used. The system used will be clearly stated on the seasonal league page.

#### 2.5.1. Round-Robin
The Round-Robin system guarantees that every team within a division compete against each other once. You can find more information about Round-Robin [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).

#### 2.5.2. Swiss System
The Swiss System allows a greater number of competitors to compete against each other in a smaller number of rounds. The first round is scheduled based on seedings, and subsequent rounds are generated according to previous team results, pairing teams with comparable records. You can find more information about the Swiss System [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament).

#### 2.5.3. Match Scoring
During the regular season, teams compete in one match each week featuring two maps. The winner of each map will be awarded two league points, while the loser is awarded zero. Regular season matches can result in a draw when each team wins one map.

#### 2.5.4. Map Draws
Draws on individual maps are not possible in ozfortress matches.

Please refer to the respective ruleset for more information:

- Sixes: [1.3.5. 5CP map draws](/rules/sixes/#135-5cp-map-draws)
- Highlander: [1.5.4. 5CP map draws](/rules/highlander/#154-5cp-map-draws)

#### 2.5.5. League Ranking
League rankings will be initially determined by match points; in the event of point draws, tiebreakers will be applied in the following order:

1. Median Buchholz (Sum of opponent scores times your score, ignoring the highest and lowest).
2. Direct Encounter (Match wins vs. tied participants).
3. Total Score (Sum of scores of all rounds).
4. Score Difference (Total score difference of all rounds).
5. Wins (Total number of rounds won).

#### 2.5.6. Tiebreaking Measures
Some formats may require additional tiebreaking measures to ensure fair and competitive scoring.
    - [Highlander Tiebreaking Measures](/rules/highlander/#16-highlander-tiebreaking-measures)

### 2.6. Playoffs
Following the conclusion of the regular season, Playoffs are played to determine the overall winner of the competition.

Typically, the top four teams in each division progress to the playoffs which adhere to the Page Playoff system. You can find more information about the Page Playoff system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system).

Please refer to the respective ruleset for more information:

- Sixes: [3. Sixes Playoffs](/rules/sixes/#3-sixes-playoffs)
- Highlander: [2. Highlander Playoffs](/rules/highlander/#2-highlander-playoffs)

#### 2.6.1. Page Playoffs

!!! warning "Please Note"
    In Page Playoffs, certain teams may participate in more matches than others. Consequently, the league standings displayed on the league page may not accurately reflect the final team placements for the season.

Page Playoffs have three rounds:

1. First round: Upper Page Playoff and Lower Page Playoff
	* In the Upper Page Playoff, the top two teams compete.
		* The winner advances to the Grand Final.
		* The loser competes in the Semi-Final.
	* In the Lower Page Playoff, the third and fourth-placed teams compete.
		* The winner advances to the Semi-Final.
		* The loser is eliminated and is awarded fourth place.
2. Semi-Final: The loser of the Upper Page Playoff and the winner Lower Page Playoff compete.
	* The winner advances to the Grand Final.
	* The loser is eliminated and is awarded third place.
3. Grand Final: The remaining two teams compete to determine the overall winner for the season.

### 2.7. Minimum Players in Matches
In matches, teams are expected to play with the required total players at all times. If a team is unable to meet this requirement with rostered players, they must utilise mercenaries.

|   Format   | Minimum Rostered Players | Required Total Players |
| :--------: | :----------------------: | :--------------------: |
|   Sixes    |        4 players         |       6 players        |
| Highlander |        6 players         |       9 players        |

If a team fields fewer than the required total players, or fewer than the required minimum rostered players, the opposing team will be awarded a forfeit win.

#### 2.7.1. Change in Team Circumstances
Team captains must **promptly** contact League Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord) in the event of any change in circumstance that might impact the team's ability to meet these requirements, even in the case of temporary issues.

#### 2.7.2. Player Disconnects During Matches
If a player disconnects during a match, teams may elect to play with one fewer player **with admin approval**. In such instances, teams must still satisfy the required minimum rostered players.

### 2.8. Forfeits
Forfeits occur when teams are unable to field the required number of players, during dispute resolutions, or as part of team-based punishments. Forfeiting a single map will result in the entire match being forfeited. Generally, non-seasonal formats such as cups do not allow any forfeits.

Forfeiting a match **will** result in the following penalties:

|                | Player Penalty |                     Team Penalty                      |
| -------------: | :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|  First Offence |       -        |         :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor         |
| Second Offence |       -        | [Team Disbandment](/rules/global/#45-disbanded-teams) |

#### 2.8.1. Forfeit Win
Forfeit wins are most commonly awarded when a team is unable to field the required number of players at the scheduled start time of the match. In such instances, it is expected that the team unable to field the required number of players forfeit the match unless they secure substitute players or mercenaries within fifteen minutes of the scheduled start time of the match.

If your opponent has not fielded the required number of players within fifteen minutes of the scheduled start time of the match, promptly contact a League Administrator. To claim a forfeit, ensure you have the following prepared:

- a screenshot of the in-game scoreboard
- screenshots of all match-related conversations

A forfeit win may also be awarded for a variety of other reasons, including:

- when the offending team fails to make an effort to organise a match
- when the offending team fields players who exceed the [Ping Limit](/rules/global/#341-ping-limit)
- as a punitive measure where serious rule breaches have been committed during a match 

A forfeit win will be recorded as a match win worth four league points.

#### 2.8.2. Mutual Forfeit
Mutual forfeits will be implemented when both teams are at fault, such as when neither team have made an effort to organise the match within a reasonable timeframe or neither team has sufficient availability to support match organisation.  

These mutual forfeits will be recorded as match losses for both teams, each worth zero league points. It's important to note that mutual forfeits contribute to a team's forfeit limit.

#### 2.8.3. Technical Forfeit
Technical issues, such as those caused by game client updates or item server disruptions, can cause issues with the smooth operation of matches. If there is a technical issue affecting your match and there is not already an advised solution, team captains should contact League Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).

In the event that technical issues beyond the teams' control prevents both teams from playing the match, a technical forfeit will be awarded. A technical forfeit will be recorded as a match draw worth two league points for each team.

#### 2.8.4. Playoffs Forfeits
**Any forfeit during Playoffs will result in immediate removal from the league and incur heavier penalties.** The remaining playoff teams below the disbanded team will move up one rank. If feasible, the playoff matches involving the disbanded team may be replayed.

### 2.9. Match Fixing
Match Fixing typically involves premeditation, planning or communication with other parties. Any effort to compromise the integrity of match play, whether involving monetary incentives or otherwise, will be reviewed and punished at the discretion of the ozfortress staff team.

---

## 3. Player Eligibility
### 3.1. Player Requirements
To be eligible to play in ozfortress competitions, either as a member of a roster or as a mercenary, a player must:

- Have an ozfortress.com account.
- Have a minimum of 500 hours, or be verified by contacting an ozfortress administrator.
- Not be under any current competition exclusion penalties, including:

    - League Bans.
    - Infraction Threshold Bans.
    - Anti-Cheat Bans .
    - VAC Bans.

- Satisfy the [Ping Limit](/rules/global/#341-ping-limit) or have an exception approved as outlined in [3.4.3. Exceptions](/rules/global/#343-exceptions).
- Have a maximum interpolation value either at the default `0.100ms` that ships with the game or lower.

    - Any value above the default interpolation value is considered an exploit.
    - See [12.1. Exploits](/rules/global/#121-exploits) for more information.

### 3.2. Player Aliases and Avatars
All player aliases and avatars (both in-game on and the ozfortress website) must be appropriate and will be contextually reviewed by ozfortress administrators. Player alias requests can be made through a player's ozfortress profile settings, and these requests will **not** be processed until the conclusion of any active ozfortress competition.

#### 3.2.1. Player Alias & Profile Guidelines
Player aliases and profiles on ozfortress.com cannot contain the following:

- Emojis or special characters.
- Blank characters or characters to otherwise break the name field.
- Links or URLs.
- A person's name or likeness. This excludes celebrities and political figures.
    - ozfortress staff reserve the right to make contradictory rulings to this on a case-by-case basis.
- Anything that violates our Community Guidelines.

To be eligible for an alias change, players must:

- Use their desired alias, or show a genuine attempt to swap to their desired alias for a majority of the competition prior to their name change.
    - This is to limit the amount of less serious name changes, as it is expected that your ozfortress alias is your most well known alias.

### 3.3. Alternative Accounts, Account Sharing & Player Accounts
**The use of alternative accounts is strictly forbidden.** Player registration and participation in ozfortress leagues must occur exclusively through one Steam account. If a player wishes to change their registered account, they must contact an ozfortress administrator. However, it is unlikely that the account will be changed without good reasoning.

!!! danger "Ban Circumvention"
    If an alternative account is used to circumvent an existing ban, all matches they participated in during the season will be overturned and will result in harsh penalties determined by ozfortress administration.

#### 3.3.1. Account Transfers
ozfortress on occasion may perform Account Transfers - replacing the Steam account associated with an ozfortress player's main Steam account, to a new Steam account. This can only occur when a player loses access to their main Steam account due to factors outside of their control. 

The application of this process is at the discretion of ozfortress staff, and is used sparingly.

If you need to have a new Steam account replace the Steam account assigned to your ozfortress account, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/HRnWkg8QbPwUh9BH8) and inform an ozfortress Head Administrator or League Director directly via Discord DMs once you have filled the form out.

#### 3.3.2. Account Sharing
Sharing your login details with a third party for use in an ozfortress match, or to provide anonymity for others to disrupt or be abusive, is strictly prohibited and will result in lengthy bans for all involved parties.

!!! danger "Ban Penalty"
    **Account Sharing will incur a two year competitive ban**. Those found helping players who are currently banned evade their ban using either an Alternate Account or sharing someone else's account will receive the same penalty.

#### 3.3.3. Team Due Diligence
When recruiting new players, captains and other team members are expected to practice due diligence to avoid penalties if an alternative account is discovered. 

Outlined below are reasonable checks players should undertake to avoid penalties:

- Be cautious of players who:
    - Perform well despite lacking traceable competitive experience.
    - Have limited experience in TF2 or utilise newer Steam accounts.
    - Claim to not own a microphone.

- Verify claims made by players of:
    - Being a "pro" in other games.
    - Returning from a prolonged absence.
    - Moving to Australia having participated in overseas competitions.

**Players should proactively inform admins of any suspicions regarding players.** Failure to perform these basic checks may result in both player and team punishments if an alternative account is discovered.

### 3.4. Out-of-Region Players
While ozfortress primarily caters to players from Australia and New Zealand, we also welcome players from Asia.

#### 3.4.1. Ping Limit
Out-of-Region Players intending to join a roster, or play as a mercenary, must meet the **in-game ping limit of 180**. If you are unsure whether you meet this requirement, you should contact a League Administrator to undergo a ping check. **It is the responsibility of Out-of-Region Players to ensure that they satisfy this ping limit.** However, if you live in a neighbouring region such as somewhere in Asia, please reach out to league administration as you may be eligible to play without needing to abide by the ping limit.

!!! warning "Ping Limit Breaches"
    In the event that a match is played featuring a player who fails to meet the ping limit requirements, League Administrators may penalise the offending team, including awarding a forfeit win.

Fielding a player who does not meet the ping limit can result in the following penalties:

|                  |    Player Penalty     |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |        Warning        |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
|   Second Offence |  One round match ban  | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences | Three round match ban |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

#### 3.4.2. Ping Fluctuations
We understand that ping fluctuations do occur and that this can result in players experiencing far greater ping than what would normally be expected. Experiencing bad network conditions in an individual instance **does not invalidate previous ping checks**. You may, however, be requested to redemonstrate that you satisfy the ping limit by a League Administrator.

#### 3.4.3. Exceptions
Some players who previously participated in our competitions may no longer meet the new limit described above. Teams hoping to roster such players should speak to a League Administrator to get an exception approved. Mercenaries are not eligible for exceptions. As mentioned in [3.4.1. Ping Limit](/rules/global/#341-ping-limit), if you live in a neighbouring region to Australia or New Zealand, you may be eligible to play without needing to abide by the ping limit.

**Exceptions are competition-dependent. As such, teams must get exceptions re-approved for each competition.**

### 3.5. Banned Players Outside of Competitions
!!! note "Please Note"
    We understand that some banned players continue to participate in our community despite being excluded from our competitions. We do not want to unnecessarily police the involvement of such players, nor force players to exclude their friends who have made poor decisions previously. We do, however, want to discourage the involvement of those who repeatedly break our rules, even after being banned.

Below clear boundaries for the participation of such players in pugs, scrims, or any other ozfortress-adjacent activity have been outlined.

#### 3.5.1. Players Banned Due to Infractions
!!! warning "Common Sense Approach"
    You should only expect this rule to come into effect when players banned due to infractions brazenly reoffend.

If a player banned for reaching the infraction limit participates in any pug or scrim and engages in conduct warranting further penalities, those responsible for that player's participation may also be penalised.

#### 3.5.2. Permanently Banned Players and Players Banned for Cheating
Permanently banned players or players banned for cheating-related offenses should not in **any** circumstance participate in pugs, scrims, or any other ozfortress-adjacent activity. Those responsible for that player's participation will be heavily penalised.

---

### 4. Teams
### 4.1. Team Aliases and Avatars
All team aliases and avatars must be appropriate and will be contextually reviewed by ozfortress administrators. Team aliases or avatars referencing an established company or brand without explicit approval are not permitted.

#### 4.1.1. Team Alias & Profile Guidelines
Team aliases and profiles cannot contain the following:

- Emojis or special characters.
- Blank characters or characters to otherwise break the name field.
- Links or URLs.
- A person's name or likeness. This excludes celebrities and political figures.
    - ozfortress staff reserve the right to make contradictory rulings to this on a case-by-case basis.
- Copyrighted names or branding that the team does not have express permission to use.
- Anything that violates our Community Guidelines.

#### 4.1.2. Premier Team Aliases
Premier teams will have their aliases held to a higher standard befitting the division's status as the highest level of Australian competitive play.

#### 4.1.3. Team and Sponsorship Tags
Team organisation and sponsorship tags are permitted but must be both appropriate and reasonable.

### 4.2. Team Captains
Captains have the ultimate responsibility for their team, representing them in organising matches and communicating with ozfortress administrators. In the event of any team-related offenses, captains will be held responsible and will be subject to punishment.

#### 4.2.1. Captain Requirements
**Teams must nominate two or three captains** and, if a captain is unavailable or departs a roster, the team is expected to nominate another captain. **All** team captains are required to join the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).

#### 4.2.2. Captaincy Bans
Captains who fail to fulfil their required responsibilities, particularly when it impacts other teams within their division, will receive a Captaincy Ban. The duration of the Captaincy Ban is determined by ozfortress administrators based on the situation.

#### 4.2.3. Mutiny Rule
At any point of the season, a two-thirds majority of players on an Active Roster may elect to nominate a new captain or remove a captain entirely. To initiate this process, a team member should contact a League Administrator. If necessary, emergency transfers may be granted as outlined in [5.4. Emergency Transfers](/rules/global/#54-emergency-transfers).

### 4.3. Active Roster
The Active Roster comprises all players, regardless of whether they are core or substitute players, that can be used in matches. Players not on a team's Active Roster must be approved for usage as a mercenary. To view players on the Active Roster of a competition, view the Leagues tab on a team's ozfortress profile.

To add or remove players from an Active Roster, transfers may be initiated as outlined in [5. Player Transfers](/rules/global/#5-player-transfers).

#### 4.3.1. Roster Limit
The number of players on an active roster is limited based on the format.

|   Format   |  Minimum  |  Maximum   |
| :--------: | :-------: | :--------: |
|   Sixes    | 6 players | 10 players |
| Highlander | 9 players | 15 players |

#### 4.3.2. Player Verification
If necessary, the [ozfortress Roster Verification Tool](https://verify.ozfortress.com/) may be used to quickly verify all players before a match. The tool will process your inputs and validate all players, displaying any roster inconsistencies.

### 4.4. Out-of-Region Players
There is no limit to the number of Out-of-Region players that may be on a roster. However, Out-of-Region players must satisfy the [3.2.1. Ping Limit](/rules/global/#341-ping-limit) or have an exception approved as outlined in [3.2.3. Exceptions](/rules/global/#323-exceptions).

### 4.5. Disbanded Teams
Captains of a disbanded team will receive a captaincy ban. Furthermore, all players on the Active Roster of a disbanded team will be barred from play for the remainder of that season. **Disbanded Teams are not awarded in-game medals.**

To prevent penalties, team captains and/or team members are encouraged to promptly engage with administrators at the first sign of issues to work towards a solution.

Captains of disbanded teams **will** face the following penalties:

|                  |      Player Penalty      | Team Penalty |
| ---------------: | :----------------------: | :----------: |
|    First Offence | Two season captaincy ban |      -       |
| Further Offences |   Six month league ban   |      -       |

In addition to the penalties listed above, captains who are seemingly unwilling to make an effort to save their roster, or who actively hinder the process of saving or running their roster will receive additional penalties.

#### 4.5.1. Undisbanding Teams
Teams who previously disband will not be undisbanded. Once a team is disbanded, they are penalized - this process will not be reversed.

### 4.6. Player Restrictions
Depending on the skill level of a player and their team, player restrictions may apply. Player restrictions are informed by many factors including, but not limited to, other teams and players within a division. As restrictions are often contextual, a player who shifts teams within a division may encounter a different set of restrictions. If you are unsure about a player's restrictions, you should contact your Division Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord). **It is the responsibility of players to ensure that they are familiar with their restrictions.**

Breaching player restrictions will result in the following penalties:

|                  |    Player Penalty     |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |    One round match    | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
|   Second Offence | Three round match ban |      :material-close-circle: Major       |
| Further Offences |  Six month match ban  |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

#### 4.6.1. Player Restriction Limit
The number of players on a roster who can be restricted is limited based on the format.

|   Format   | Player Restriction Limit |
| :--------: | :---------------------: |
|   Sixes    |        No limit.        |
| Highlander |        5 players        |

## 5. Player Transfers
Teams can request player transfers at **any point** during the **regular** season. Transfers are processed at the conclusion of each round. League Administrators may deny transfers, particularly if they break [Roster Limits](/rules/global/#431-roster-limit) or [Player Restriction Limits](/rules/global/#461-player-restriction-limit).

To learn more, including how to initiate a player transfer, see the [Transfers](/info/transfers/) page.

### 5.1. Transfer Limits
There are limits on the number of inbound transfers based on the format.

|                    |   Sixes   | Highlander |
| -----------------: | :-------: | :--------: |
|  Inbound per round | 1 player  | 2 players  |
| Inbound per season | 4 players | 6 players  |

There are no limits on outbound transfers.

### 5.2. Individual Player Transfer Limit
A player may only change rosters a maximum of two times per season.

### 5.3. Roster Lock
Before the conclusion of the regular season, teams may no longer change their roster. This information will be found on seasonal league pages.

### 5.4. Emergency Transfers
League Administrators can approve Emergency Transfers for unavoidable player losses, even if it exceeds regular transfer limits. If an Emergency Transfer is needed, notify your Division Administrators immediately through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).

## 6. Mercenaries
Mercenaries are players not rostered on a team's Active Roster that is used in place of an unavailable team member. 

### 6.1. Requirements
**All mercenaries must meet all player requirements as outlined in [3.1. Player Requirements](/rules/global/#31-player-requirements)**. This includes ping limits and not facing any exclusion penalties.

#### 6.1.1. Out-of-Region Mercenary Exceptions
Out-of-Region mercenaries are not eligible for exceptions as outlined in [3.4.3. Exceptions](/rules/global/#343-exceptions). However, they have an exception on a team's Active Roster, they are able to act as a mercenary.

### 6.2. Mercenary Approval
Mercenaries **must be approved by an opposing team captain**. When requesting a mercenary, captains should provide the following information to the opposing team:

- a link to the mercenary's ozfortress profile
- which class(es) they intend for the mercenary to play
- which player the mercenary is replacing

Once a mercenary is approved, it **must** be stated in the match thread.

Fielding a mercenary without approval **will** result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences |       -        |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

#### 6.2.1. Reasonable Mercenary Denial
Teams have the right to deny players from the same division, but reasonable requests should be accommodated. We recommend contacting a League Administrator if you are unsure of the skill level of the requested mercenary.

When a League Administrator is required to step in to solve a mercenary dispute, the level of the requested mercenary will be compared to the player they are replacing. This is not a requirement for teams when negotiating mercenaries between each other, but will be the primary consideration for us when resolving disputes.

#### 6.2.2. Requesting Players From Lower Divisions
A player who is completely unrestricted in a division below that in which a match is being played should be approved without any restrictions. If a team is concerned about the impact of such a player, team captains are encouraged to contact their Division Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).

#### 6.2.3. Contesting Mercenary Denials
If three reasonable mercenaries are denied, you may contact your Division Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).

#### 6.2.4. Mercenary Class Locking
**Teams may lock mercenaries to specific classes**. Unless mercenaries have been explicitly locked to a class, they can play any class of their choosing. **Any class locks placed on mercenaries must be stated in the match thread.**

In Sixes, mercenaries can also be locked from playing certain off classes as outlined in [1.1.3. Mercenary Off Class Locking](/rules/sixes/#113-mercenary-off-class-locking).

#### 6.2.5. Restricted Players as Mercenaries
The restrictions of a player still apply when accepted as a mercenary. They are prohibited from playing those restricted classes in divisions below where the restriction was set.

This is also true for the division where the restriction was set. However, if an opposing team would like to ignore the restrictions of a mercenary within their division, they can do so but **must seek administrator approval**.

Restrictions do not apply in divisions above where the restriction was set, however such players are still subject to potential class locking as outlined in [6.2.4. Mercenary Class Locking](/rules/global/#624-mercenary-class-locking).

### 6.3. Mercenary Limits
The number of mercenaries per team allowed at any moment is limited based on the format.

|   Format   | Mercenary Limit |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
|   Sixes    |  2 mercenaries  |
| Highlander |  3 mercenaries  |

### 6.4. Reusing Mercenaries
Teams can only make use of the same mercenary within **two matches per season**. There is **no limit** on the amount of mercenaries used per season, only on one specific player.

## 7. Match Organisation
All scheduling follows AEST (if [Daylight Saving](https://www.nsw.gov.au/about-nsw/daylight-saving) is not in effect) or AEDT (if [Daylight Saving](https://www.nsw.gov.au/about-nsw/daylight-saving) is in effect). Times stated below do not change based on daylight savings, meaning "7PM AEST/AEDT" refers to 7PM for both AEST and AEDT.

### 7.1. Organisation Responsibility
Team captains are responsible for all match organisation tasks. If they are unable to complete these tasks or ensure these tasks are completed, they must nominate another team member to ensure their completion.

### 7.2. Team Captain Discord
ozfortress competitions use a Team Captain Discord for **all** communication, including match organisation and contacting League Administration. Teams should not contact League Administration regarding ongoing competitions externally of this Discord, as this may be considered an instance of [1.5. Admin Shopping](/rules/global/#15-admin-shopping).

Communicating externally of the Team Captain Discord **will** result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |    Warning     |                 Warning                  |
|   Second Offence |    Warning     |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
| Further Offences | One Match Ban  | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

### 7.3. Match Organisation & Playable Match Days
After the match is posted on the ozfortress website, a Discord channel is created for Team Captains to communicate available days and times. Playable Match Days are outlined below.

We encourage all teams to set their match date/time, but in the case of a dispute an administrator may enforce the default match day and/or times.

|   Format   | Default Match Day | Default Match Times  |
| :--------: | :---------------: | :------------------: |
|   Sixes    |     Thursday      | 8PM or 9PM AEST/AEDT |
| Highlander |      Sunday       | 8PM or 9PM AEST/AEDT |

Matches can be played at any point **during** a round. The days below are not the only possible days matches can be played on, however, any days outside those below will require approval from your division administrator. See [7.3.4. Emergency Extensions for more info](/rules/global/#734-emergency-extensions).

| **Format** |   **Match Days**   |
| :--------: | :----------------: |
|   Sixes    | Sunday - Thursday  |
| Highlander | Wednesday - Sunday |

#### 7.3.1. Organisation Deadlines
Teams should aim to have their match organised by the following deadlines.

|   Format   | Match date/time organised |
| :--------: | :-----------------------: |
|   Sixes    |   Monday 7PM AEST/AEDT    |
| Highlander |  Thursday 7PM AEST/AEDT   |

We understand that this is not always possible, but clear efforts should be made to do so.

Showing insufficient effort in meeting these deadlines may result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       -        |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
|   Second Offence |       -        |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
| Further Offences |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

##### 7.3.1.1. Map Veto / Pick & Ban Process Completion Deadline
In addition to the deadlines above, all match set/map veto or pick/ban processes need to be completed 24 hours prior to the agreed upon/scheduled match time.

#### 7.3.2. Scheduling Issues
If the other team is unresponsive in the Team Captain Discord, or not making a reasonable effort, contact Division Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord) immediately.

#### 7.3.3. Reorganising Casted Matches
Matches being cast by Approved Casting Organisations must adhere to the agreed-upon match time. If rescheduling a match is necessary, this must be done **at least** twenty-four hours in advance to support the casting organisation.

Showing insufficient effort in meeting this requirement may result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |             Team Penalty              |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       -        | :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor |
|   Second Offence |       -        | :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor |
| Further Offences |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

#### 7.3.4. Emergency Extensions
If required, teams may seek an **emergency** extension by contacting their Division Administrators through the [Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord). Opposing teams are not obligated to accept a request for an extension, although compromise and sportsmanship between teams are encouraged. Missing core players is **not** grounds for extension; a backup player or mercenary should be used.

### 7.4. ozfortress Match Threads
Match Threads on the ozfortress website are used to communicate the essential details of matches. It is expected that until the completion of an official match, players do not post anything non-essential to the flow of the match.

Inappropriate or unrelated posting in Match Threads may result in the following penalties:

|                  |   Player Penalty    |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       Warning       |                 Warning                  |
|   Second Offence | One round match ban |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
| Further Offences | One round match ban | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

#### 7.4.1. Match Info Requirements
The following **must** be posted in the match thread/match page for each official match:

 1. The agreed-upon day and time **after confirmation**. If the match time is changed, or the match is rescheduled, this update should be posted in the match thread as well.
 2. A link to each map's logs.tf page **within 24 hours** of the match's conclusion.
 3. Any other match details **within 24 hours** of the match's conclusion.
 4. In the event of a mercenary being required, this must be posted by the team requesting the mercenary in the match thread **prior** to the commencement of the match. This must include any class locks as described in [6.2.4. Mercenary Class Locking](/rules/global/#624-mercenary-class-locking). This does not mean you need to request the mercenary via the match page, you can do this via the match channel in the Team Captain Discord.
 5. Once the match has finished, submit the match scores on the match page **within 24 hours of the matchs' conclusion**.

Failing to all required information in/on Match Threads/Pages may result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       -        |                 Warning                  |
|   Second Offence |       -        |                 Warning                  |
| Further Offences |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

!!! warning "Please Note"
    League Administrators will use their discretion when penalising teams for failing to post all required match info. If a team consistently fails to post this information, we will act. But if it's just some info here and there, League Administrators may opt to post it themselves. **Please note however, it is not their responsibility to do so.**

#### 7.4.2. Match Log Issues
If logs are unavailable, the **Home Team** must take a screenshot of the score for each map and upload them to the match thread **within 24 hours** of a match's conclusion. If this is not possible, demos may be requested to validate match results.

### 7.5. Map Selection
#### 7.5.1. Regular Season Map Selection
For regular season matches, two maps are determined by League Administrators and can be found on the seasonal league page.

In Sixes, certain divisions in certain competitions may employ a map selection system as outlined in [2.2. Regular Season Map Selection Order](/rules/sixes/#22-regular-season-map-selection-order).

#### 7.5.2. Playoff Map Selection
For playoff matches, the selection of maps is the responsibility of the team captains. This process should be completed at least 24 hours prior to the agreed-upon match time. **In the event of a playoff match being casted, this process must be completed at least 24 hours prior.**

For playoff map selection order, please refer to the respective ruleset for more information:

- Sixes: [3.4. Playoff Map Selection Order](/rules/sixes/#34-playoff-map-selection-order)

|   Second Offence |       -        |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
| Further Offences |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

## 8. Matches
**During Playoffs, the higher-seeded team is considered the Home team.**

### 8.1. Match Servers
The Home team is responsible for organising the game server and managing it appropriately during the match, including executing necessary configs.

If there are issues with the Home team's server selection, the Away team may contact a League Administrator.

Please see [10. Servers](/rules/global/#10-servers) for more information, including the default server provider and server location.

#### 8.1.1. Match Invasion
Joining a match server where you are not rostered on either team's roster is considered as Match Invasion. Malicious Match Invasion will be penalised heavily within ozfortress.

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       :material-close-circle: Major         |   -   |
|   Second Offence |       -        |   -   |
| Further Offences |       :material-close-circle: Major         |   -   |

### 8.2. Team Starting Side
In Regular Season matches, the Away team selects their team colour. In Playoff matches, the team that did not pick the map will choose their team color.

### 8.3. Match Disputes
To lodge a dispute or report misconduct within a match, please contact a League Administrator as soon as possible. Please do not bring the debate to the public while it is being resolved.

### 8.4. Distinct Aliases
Aliasing is allowed in matches. However, all players must have distinct aliases. ozfortress defines Distinct Aliases as a player's most recognizable alias, or current ozfortress.com alias.

Failing to do will result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       -        |                 Warning                  |
|   Second Offence |       -        |  :material-alert-circle-outline: Minor   |
| Further Offences |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |

#### 8.4.1. Correct Aliases Upon Request
During matches cast by Approved Casting Organisations, players must use an alias matching their ozfortress profile upon request. Whilst an exact match is not required, player aliases should be immediately recognisable to casters and viewers.

### 8.5. Spectators
Players in spectator are strictly prohibited during any match. League Administrators are allowed to remain in server spectator for any reason.

#### 8.5.1. Live Coaching
In-match coaching by **any** means is strictly prohibited. This includes during pauses or before the commencement of a golden cap tiebreaker. This clause excludes coaching **outside** of an official match, such as demo reviewing or strategy sessions.

### 8.6. Player Swaps
Teams may swap players on their Active Roster during the match. To switch a player, the replaced player must leave the server before the new player joins.

### 8.7. Mercenary Swaps
Teams may swap mercenaries during the match with the approval of the opposing team. To switch a mercenary, the replaced mercenary must leave the server before the new mercenary joins. **Both** mercenaries must be stated in the Match Thread.

### 8.8. Pausing
Pauses during a match are allowed for any reason, except for immediately after readying up with the intent of delaying the match.

The match may only be unpaused by the team who initiated the pause, with confirmation from the opposing teams. Unpausing initiates a five-second countdown.

#### 8.8.1. Pause Limits
Each team is allowed two pauses per match, with a combined total time limit of ten minutes. However, the pause limit can be extended if agreed upon by team captains.

#### 8.8.2. Tactical Pauses
Tactical pauses *are* allowed but contribute to the pause limits described above. They should not be used to disrupt ongoing plays.

#### 8.8.3. Pause Command
To pause a match, teams must open their console and send the command: `pause`. The same command can be sent to unpause the match.

#### 8.8.4. Repause Command
To allow a player to rejoin the server during a pause, use the command: `repause`. No warning is required to use the repause command.

### 8.9. Demo Recording
POV demo files must be recorded for all matches played on ozfortress servers or using ozfortress configs, and provided upon request by an ozfortress administrator. 

When playing on an ozfortress server or are using an ozfortress config, you are required to record:

- Official ozfortress matches.
- Scrimmage/practise matches.
- Pickup game/"Pug" matches.
- Any other match type playing an ozfortress format.

**Players must retain their POV demo files for at 6 months.** For further details, visit the [Demo Requests FAQ page](/faq/demo_requests/).

#### 8.9.1. Demo Checking
POV demo files may be requested by staff as a tool for resolving match disputes or for ensuring competitive integrity. All players in a match can have their demos requested, including substitutes and mercenaries.

Failure to provide POV demo files upon request for any match requested will result in the following penalties:

|     Offence      |   Failing a Demo Request    |               Failing an Anti-Cheat Demo Request               |
| ---------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence | Warning | Warning |
|   Second Offence | 3-Month League Ban | 1-Year League Ban |
| Further Offences | 1-Year League Ban | 2-Year League Ban |

---

## 9. Broadcasting Matches
Official matches may be broadcasted on any live stream platform, provided the coverage originates from an observer in SourceTV or from a rostered player streaming their POV from the live server. Broadcasting from spectator mode in a live, official match server is **strictly prohibited**.

### 9.1. ozfortress Representation
ozfortress asks that all match broadcasts by both casting organisations and individuals follow a fairly simple philosophy: represent our community as one that is open and accepting. We feel this is fair, and doesn't impact anyone's right to voice their own opinion, even of ozfortress.

### 9.2. Approved Casting Organisations
Approved Casting Organisations may broadcast matches without requiring team approval. This status is reserved for casting organisations maintaining high production and coverage standards and contributing positively to talent development.

The current Approved Casting Organisations are:

- KritzKast
- CappingTV
- BearCasts

Upon request, Approved Casting Organizations must be provided with server details and an updated list of participating players and mercenaries.

#### 9.2.1. Team Responsibilities
Teams who are in a match being casted by an Approved Casting Organization need to follow all of that organizations directives in regards to when each map starts. This is to ensure they are ready to go live.

#### 9.2.2. Becoming an Approved Casting Organization
Casting Organizations may contact the League Director or Media Coordinator to become an Approved Casting Organization. Approval will only be granted once it is determined by ozfortress that the coverage meets approved standards.

### 9.3. Unapproved Casting Organizations
Unapproved Casting Organizations, including individuals, **must secure approval from both teams to broadcast a match**. Casting priority for matches is given to Approved Casting Organizations.

#### 9.3.1. Failing to seek permission
Unapproved Casting Organisations (or individuals) who fail to seek permission to cast a match from the captains of both teams involved in that official match will receive penalties.

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       Warning         |   -   |
|   Second Offence |       -        |   -   |
| Further Offences |       1-Round Match Ban         |   -   |

#### 9.3.2. Banned Players covering official matches
Anyone with an active ozfortress ban, is prohibited from covering any official match on their own channels. Banned players are allowed to appear on, or cast for Approved Casting Organizations.

### 9.4. Player Stream Delay
**Stream sniping is not an actionable offence** so players are responsible for setting a stream delay such that they do not impact their team.

---

## 10. Servers
### 10.1. SourceTV Settings
A match server **must** have an STV Delay (stv_delay) of **at least 90 seconds**. Any reduction in this delay, either during or before the match, will result in severe penalties. The same penalties apply if STV Map Change Protect is disabled during a casted official match.

Failing to meet these requirements will result in the following penalties:

|                  | Player Penalty |               Team Penalty               |
| ---------------: | :------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    First Offence |       -        | :material-close-circle-outline: Moderate |
| Further Offences |       -        |      :material-close-circle: Major       |

### 10.2. Server Providers
For matches (and in the case of disputes), **au.serveme.tf** serves as the default server provider. However, if both teams agree, **Matcha Bookable** servers can be used.

#### 10.2.1. Third-Party Servers
For those interested in running their own servers, please refer to the required server configurations and plugins [here](/guides/selfmanaged_servers/). An ozfortress administrator must review your server configs to ensure they meet the match-ready standard.

### 10.3. Server Locations
For matches (and in case of disputes), **Sydney** is the default server location. While teams can opt for other server providers (see [10.2. Server Providers](/rules/global/?h=server#102-server-providers)) who can offer other locations, opposing teams are not obligated to agree to a server location change.

### 10.4. Server Interruptions
In the event of an ongoing match being interrupted, the match must resume from the point at which the last round was completed. Any ongoing rounds will be restarted, while completed rounds will remain as is.

## 11. League Prizes
### 11.1. Prize Pools
Some competitions may feature a prize pool, as communicated on the seasonal league page.

#### 11.1.1. Prize Pool Payouts
Players will receive payouts two months after the conclusion of the last grand final match. Team captains of winning teams will be contacted to assist in providing necessary information for the payout.

### 11.2. In-Game Medals
Our seasonal leagues and certain non-seasonal competitions feature in-game medals.

#### 11.2.1. Medal Distribution
Players will receive medals upon the conclusion of a competition. However, please note that League Administrators have other responsibilities, so the distribution of medals may take some time. If you are missing a medal after the distribution period, please contact your Division Administrators.

### 11.3. Prize Eligibility
To be eligible for prizes, you must be on the team's Active Roster for that competition and not face any exclusion penalties.

---

## 12. Cheating, Exploits and Bans
### 12.1. Exploits
The intention of exploiting any aspect of the game for an unfair advantage, whether they are explicitly listed or not, is prohibited. We consider there to be two categories of exploits; **Game Modification exploits** and **Game Mechanic exploits**. Game Modification exploitation is the act of modifying game files (and typically bypassing sv_pure 2) to gain an unfair advantage. Game Mechanic exploitation is typically engine exploits, bugs, or abuse of unattended gameplay features that are outside the scope of competitive fairness and play.

#### 12.1.1. Game Modification
This is commonly treated as akin to cheating when malicious, as it is direct game file manipulation to gain an unfair advantage. Any item not explicitly stated as allowed is prohibited.

##### Explicitly Prohibited Game Modification
+ Using scripts/macros that allow you to bypass movement or engine restrictions.
  - Panic scripts.
  - Bunnyhop scripts.
  - 180-degree Charge turn scripts.
  - Other turn scripts.
+ Other scripts that disrupt hitboxes or gameplay, including but not limited to interpolation switchers, hud_reloadscheme stutters, or anything that causes a networked load on other clients or your own.
+ Sound-based exploits (spy decloak modifiers, footstep modifiers, audio mixers or equalizers, etc).
+ Sniper scope transparency/removal of the sniper scope.
+ Large shadows and/or box shadows.
+ Removal/replacement of weapon sounds or particles (eg. transparent flame particles)
+ Removing map objects/props or making them transparent.
+ Malicious use of the retry command.
+ Editing the player HUD to see team medigun info such as ubercharge percentage.

A general rule of thumb for whether or not something is or isn't allowed is this:
> "Is the mod/custom file/change against a general sense of competitive integrity and fairness?" **If so it is likely prohibited.**

Please note this does not serve as a rule, and you should check with a League Administrator before making use of any suspected exploit or game mechanic.

##### Explicitly Allowed Game Modification

+ Custom HUDs.
+ Custom Autoexec, class configs, etc.
+ Flat textures.
+ Custom Hitsounds & Killsounds.
+ No hats/cosmetics mods.

    + This includes stickybomb projectiles, a medic's current medi-gun percentage and charge, an engineer's buildings, etc.

#### 12.1.2. Game Mechanic Exploits
Game Mechanic exploits are typically map, client or server exploits used to gain an unfair advantage. **The following exploits are banned**:

+ Placing the Engineer’s buildings outside of the map, in indestructible locations or anywhere where it is not visible.
+ Entering areas that are “out of bounds” or not in playable space.
+ Resupplying by using spawn regions outside of spawn bounds.
+ Exploiting the map design to enter areas that aren’t within regular bounds, for any means or use excluding Wallbugs and Edgebugs as documented in [Explicitly Allowed Game Mechanic exploits](/rules/global/#explicitly-allowed-game-mechanic-exploits).
+ Map-based exploits (water jump scoping, etc).
+ Hiding sticky grenades (AKA "stickies") or engineer buildings inside of props or geometry **where they cannot be destroyed by normal means** (any class, out of the map, etc) due to differences in their visual and physical collisions is **considered an exploit**.
+ Any form of complete animation break, including but not limited to:
  + T-Posing or "Civilian" mode.
  + Contracker exploitation.
  + Ragdoll "mods" that break the intended effect of a Spy's Dead Ringer item.
+ Purposeful Sniper scoped-in crouch exploitation is prohibited.
> When a sniper scopes in whilst crouched, it is possible to obscure up to or above 50% of that sniper's character model whilst still maintaining vision around the objects obscuring their model.
>
> **We understand that this is potentially difficult to police, however, it will often be very clear when someone is intentionally abusing this mechanical oversight.** We will be reviewing each reported case of this behaviour individually, and not blanket banning any instance that could be purposeful exploitation.
+ Uber Pause bug
    - A bug where medics continue to build Uber during a pause while healing a player. This bug should be prevented by server plugins, but in the event it does happen, both teams should be made aware and an administrator should be contacted.
- Using an exploit as an Engineer to be able to hit players twice without a delay with melees
+ Pyro reflect spam visual bug.

##### Explicitly Allowed Game Mechanic exploits

+ Wallbugs.
+ Edgebugs.
+ C-taps.

Reports made regarding exploitation are **reviewed on a case-by-case basis**.
The lists above are not exhaustive. **If you are unsure if something is considered an exploit**, **please contact an administrator** and request a ruling be made. Usage of any banned exploit or exploit with malicious intent **will** result in punishments. Punishments will range between **3 months** to **24 months** depending on multiple factors, including but not limited to **severity**, **intent**, **maliciousness**, etc.

### 12.2. Third-Party Software
The use of any third-party addons, hooks, programs or wrappers that interact with or alter the Team Fortress 2 client, its appearance or behaviour to gain an unfair advantage is a bannable offence. This includes usage of such programs on alternative accounts not registered with ozfortress.

### 12.3. Malicious Server Administration & Server Abuse
The use of any server commands, variables, or plugins to gain an unfair advantage or to interfere with an ozfortress match is prohibited. Once the match is underway, the server administrator must let the match run its course and not make any changes without the consent of both teams.

Some examples of what we consider malicious:

- Using server commands to gain an unfair advantage, or "cheat".
- Prematurely ending the game via config execution without the approval of both teams.
- Breaking of config or format limitations.

!!! info "Server Abuse from those outside of the official match"
    If you happen upon the connect info or RCON info of a server actively being used in an official match, it is ozfortress' expectation that you report it to the teams and/or an ozfortress League Administrator.

    Use of that RCON info to disrupt a match will incur even heavier penalties.

### 12.4. ozfortress Bans
Members banned on the ozfortress website are also banned from leading teams in ozfortress competitions. Players banned from the ozfortress website may also be subject to competition bans and are considered under probation. It is standard for those serving Competitive, Anti-Cheat or Infraction Threshold bans to be banned from our Discord server as well as being barred from using some bookable server services. Please contact an ozfortress administrator for further clarification.
