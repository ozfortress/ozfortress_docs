## 1. BBall Format
### 1.1. Class Limits
The following class limits are expected to be observed for official matches. Breaking these limits in any way is considered cheating, and depending on administrator discretion could lead to league penalties or a match result being overturned.

#### 1.1.1. Core Class Limits
- 2 Soldiers

### 1.2. Unlocks (Whitelist)
The BBall whitelist can be found [here](https://whitelist.tf/ozfortress_bball).

Failure to observe weapon whitelisting will result in league penalties. For BBall, the following weapons are also allowed:

- **Soldier**
    - Shotgun

#### 1.2.1. Weapon Pickups
Dropped weapons can be picked up.

### 1.3. Scoring
In BBall, all maps are Capture The Flag (CTF) maps, and follow a first to twenty (20) captures with a ten minute team clock.

### 1.4. Golden Caps & Tiebreakers
Each map will be played until a team has scored twenty (20) times. If the score is tied at the end of the ten minute clock, another round must be played where the first to score wins, acting as a tiebreaker.

### 1.5. Scheduling 
Due to the time constraints surrounding BBall, once the server connect string is sent, all players must immediately join the server. Failure to have two rostered players readied up in the server within five minutes of the match start time will result in a forfeit loss. 

### 1.6. Substitutes & Mercenaries
Substitutes are not allowed for BBall, but Mercenaries are, but only with cup administrator approval. If one player on the roster becomes unavailable prior to the cup, please reach out to staff to swap a new player in.

### 1.7. Rosters
#### 1.7.1. Roster Size
BBall in ozfortress only allows for two (2) players. In the event of needing to replace a player, one will need to be removed. To initiate a swap, contact an administrator.

### 1.8. Forfeiting
Teams are allowed to forfeit a single match within BBall. If you can no longer play in the competition, endeavour to inform your division administrator and ensure they remove your signup before the competition starts so you do not face any penalty. If you cannot complete/play a match when the competition is live, you will be forfeited. Upon a second forfeit, your roster will be disbanded, and your team will see penalties.

#### 1.8.1. Claiming a Forfeit
If the team hasn't communicated with you within three minutes, or is more than five minutes late, contact your division administrator to claim a forfeit win. Do not wait longer than this as it will affect the remainder of the tournament. 

## 2. BBall Playoffs
### 2.1. Playoff Match Format
Playoff matches are almost exclusively played as a best of three (BO3) series with maps selected from the map pool. In a best of three (BO3) match, the team that wins 2 out of 3 maps wins the match. Each map should be played as per [1.3. Scoring](/rules/bball/#13-scoring).

### 2.2. Playoff Map Selection Order
#### 2.2.1. Best of Three Playoff Matches
For playoff matches following a best of three (BO3) format, the **higher seeded team** is awarded a map pick advantage prior to bans.

**Maps must be played in the order in which they were picked.**

Using the Pick/Ban system on your Match Thread:

1. **Team B bans** a map
2. **Team A picks** a map
3. **Team A picks** a map
4. **Team B picks** a map

#### 2.2.2. Best of One Playoff Matches
For playoff matches following a best of one (BO1) format, the **higher seeded team** is awarded two map bans, with the **lower seeded team** only being awarded one map ban.

**Maps must be played in the order in which they were picked.**

Using the Pick/Ban system on your Match Thread:

1. **Team B bans** a map
2. **Team A bans** a map
3. **Team A bans** a map
4. **Final map is picked by Team A, however there will only be one map in the pool left to pick.**

## 3. Pausing
Pauses during a match are allowed for any reason, except for immediately after readying up with the intent of delaying the match.

The match may only be unpaused by the team who initiated the pause, with confirmation from the opposing team in in-game chat. Unpausing initiates a five-second countdown.

### 3.1. Pause Limits
Each team is allowed two pauses per match, with a combined total time limit of five minutes. 

### 3.2. Tactical Pauses
Tactical pauses are allowed but contribute to the pause limits described above. They should not be used to disrupt ongoing plays.

### 3.3. Pause Command
To pause a match, teams must open their console and send the command: ``pause``. The same command can be sent to unpause the match.

### 3.4. Repause Command
To allow a player to rejoin the server during a pause, use the command: ``repause``. No warning is required to use the repause command.

### 3.5. Abuse of the Pause function
If a team is breaching any of the pause rules, a tournament administrator must be contacted **immediately.**

## 4. Player Eligibility
### 4.1. Ping Requirements
 BBall will not follow our Global Ruleset Ping or Out of Region rules. Out-of-Region Players intending to join a roster, or play as a mercenary, must meet the in-game ping limit of 150. If you are unsure whether you meet this requirement, prior to the tournament starting you should contact a League Administrator to undergo a ping check. It is the responsibility of Out-of-Region Players to ensure that they satisfy this ping limit before the beginning of the tournament. 

## 5. BBall Play Rules
### 5.1. Hoop Guarding
Hoop "Guarding" in BBall is the act of physically sitting on the hoop, preventing the enemy team from capturing the intel. In ozfortress BBall competitions, this act is **prohibited**. Any deliberate instance of this found will result in a match forfeit.
