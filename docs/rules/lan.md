# General LAN Ruleset
A LAN ruleset provided by ozfortress, created with help from the team behind LAN Downunder/Summer Brawl. This ruleset is created to be as free of association as possible, and can be used for any Team Fortress 2 LAN event, by anyone. The hope is this will save organisers time when constructing guidelines and charters for events.

This ruleset also makes a number of expectations to the general running of your event. For example, minimum player requirements, eligibility, systems used, etc.

## Format Specificity
Rules within this ruleset are strictly for offline specific events/LAN events, and though each ruleset may share the same rules, the contents of each are likely different if they are listed in one of the format rulesets and not the Global Ruleset.

## 1. LAN Tournaments
This ruleset is designed for events such as the LAN Downunder and the TF2 Summer Brawl, which are typically run in short periods (1-2 days).

### 1.1. Round Robin
In the first portion of the tournament, each team competes against each other once, playing a best-of-one series picked out of a nine (9) map pool (this can be found in our [League Info](/info/map_history/)). This map pool is chosen by the tournament administration prior to the start of the season, using mostly poll data. Each match is typically expected to last an average of thirty minutes, but team's should always be ready to play longer.

### 1.2. Playoffs Stage
In Playoffs, each match or round is a Best of 3 map scenario, picked and banned from the nine (9) map pool found in the Round Robin stage (this can be found in our [League Info](/info/map_history/)). Playoffs fixtures are almost always expected to last at least thirty minutes per map, for an average runtime of ninety minutes to two hours. Once all but two teams are eliminated, a best-of-five Grand Final series is played, as such teams should expect a runtime of anywhere between two to three hours.

### 1.3. Bracket Systems used
LAN tournament formats vary depending on the length of the event. The first stage of the tournament (depending on signup numbers, format and event length) will typically be run on a Round Robin format, where each team plays each other once. The second stage will typically be run on a single elimination format, where teams play till they're eliminated once.


## 2. Teams
### 2.1. Rosters
#### 2.1.1. Roster Size Requirements/Limits
- Minimum roster size is six (6).
- Maximum roster size is ten (8).

### 2.2. Mercenaries
Typically mercenery's are prohibited in LAN events unless authorised by a tournament administrator.

## 3. Offline Specific Rules

### 3.2. Setup time
Players will have a designated time frame prior to each match day to ensure they are properly prepared. Players participating in a LAN event must arrive on-site no later than the time specified by the Referees.

Referees will inform Players and Teams of their scheduled preparation time frame as part of their Match schedule. Referees may change the schedule at any time. Setup Time is considered to have begun once Players enter the Match Area. Setup is comprised of the following:

#### 3.2.4. No fewer than five minutes before the Match is scheduled to begin, a Referee will confirm with each Player that their setup is complete.
#### 3.2.5. Once all twelve Players in a Match have confirmed completion of setup, Players will be asked to join the game server and join their selected team.

### 3.3. Equipment

Some events will have a media day, where participants will be photographed, filmed and interviewed by the media crew for the event presentation.

Players of the winning team have to stay in the tournament area for the winners ceremony and interview after the Grand Final.

### 3.7. COVID-19
As the situation can always change, restrictions may apply at both state and federal level. If an event is cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions, all teams will be refunded the entry fee. Players agree by attending LAN events that you have received at least two doses of an Australian Government approved COVID-19 vaccine prior to entry. You additionally agree that you have received no positive COVID-19 tests within the last week.

If a player is showing signs or symptoms of COVID-19, they will be subject to all procedures, as covered by the state's health and safety protocols. If a player is rendered unable to play or continue to play because of a lack of medical clearance, or if the team is unable to field a roster that is compliant with the ruleset, the team shall forfeit the tournament. These teams may be eligible for mercenary usage.

## 4. Format
Teams are expected to play with all their core players at all times within an official match. If a team cannot field field enough players from their roster or approved mercenaries, teams are permitted to play with less players with approval, and the opposing team is permitted to keep their full roster. Teams that cannot field enough players will be automatically disqualified and subsequently forfeited. Teams must still observe mercenary rules and limits outlined in this ruleset.
