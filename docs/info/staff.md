# Current & Past Staff
!!!abstract "Staff Tag Disclaimer"
    ozfortress has seen dozens of staff members over the last couple decades, and without them it would not be where it is today. Below you'll find the current and past staff members listed with contact info. Please note, if a "staff" member is not on this page, they are not a staff member and you should report them to the League Director.

    ozfortress staff are no longer expected to run the "ozfortress" tag in their Steam alias, so this page is the best resource to check if a staff member is who they say they are.

    **If you are found actively trying to impersonate, apply affiliation with, or deceive community members by acting as a member of the ozfortress staff, you will be punished.**

## Team Leads/Heads
Have an issue that isn't within the Sixes or Highlander realm? Good chance our Team Leads/Heads will have an answer for you. As always, we ask that you go through either `#sixes-support` / `#highlander-support` / `#ticket-support` within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7E6kC2H "If you have issues with verification, please contact an administrator via the sidebar in Discord.") first before contacting one of us directly.

## New Player Experience Team
Our New Player Experience Team was formed to help us further bridge the gap between competitive TF2 and the casual community. Good chance, if we're running team drives, icebreakers or cups, these guys are involved!

## Public Behaviour Panel members
There are currently three Behaviour Panel members who are public, with two members who are not. We leave this decision purely up to the individual, however we do ask that those in an administration role (or those who were) are public-facing if possible. We will always strive to have an equal ratio of staff/non-staff members, if not strive for more members who are not serving in an administration role.

| Name | Discord |
| ---- | ------- |
| [core](https://ozfortress.com/users/491 "Please feel free to reach out to me via Discord @coreobs." ) (Head of Behaviour Panel) | [@coreobs](https://discordapp.com/users/226205616773922816) |
| [snazzy](https://ozfortress.com/users/37 "Please DO NOT contact panel members, contact the Head of the Behaviour Panel only.") (Panel member) | [@thelampshade22](https://discordapp.com/users/125913179690631169) |
| [ory](https://ozfortress.com/users/1303 "Please DO NOT contact Advisors, they no longer actively sit on the panel. ory was there at the beginning when the Behaviour Panel (formerly known as the infractions team) was formed, and has been crucial throughout the years. He now sits in an Advisory role.") (Advisor) | N/A |
| [samson](https://ozfortress.com/users/205 "Please DO NOT contact Advisors, they no longer actively sit on the panel. samson was one of our longest serving Behaviour Panel leads, overseeing years of behaviour management. Thank you for your work legend!") (Advisor) | N/A |

Those above marked with Advisor are only on the panel in an advisory capacity. Advisors are only called upon in difficult/edge cases or when we need another opinion. Those in the Advisor role will only ever be past long-serving panel members, panel leads, Head Admins, etc.

**Please DO NOT contact panel members or advisors directly**. The only public point of contact should ever be the Head of the Behaviour Panel or League Director. This is so all reports, queries, etc - go through the appropriate avenues and processes.
