## Bans
Bans within ozfortress typically come as a result of poor player conduct, use of third-party cheat clients, use of exploits or breaches of clauses in our Competitive Rulesets or Community Guidelines. 

!!! abstract "Please Note"
    Ban reasoning is not always limited to just the aforementioned reasons, administration reserves the right to make decisions counter to the bans listed below for any case we deem necessary, but this is typically left to difficult or uncommon cases which are rare.

### Game Server Bans
All ozfortress bans excluding Permanent Bans are subject to the following:

- All users receiving any ban below will be banned from ozfortress bookable servers for most of their ban. However, in the last three months of their ban, they will be able to join au.serveme.tf and Matcha Bookable servers again, but will be unable to use the in-game chat or voice chat. This has been done in an attempt to allow banned players to begin to reintegrate into the community.

### League Bans
League Bans are issued as a result of serious breaches in our Competitive Rulesets (Global Ruleset, Sixes Ruleset, Highlander Ruleset and LAN Ruleset). These may be Round Bans, or 6-Month/1-Year/2-Year League Bans.

### Unfair Play Bans (Anti-Cheat Bans)
Unfair Play Bans are typically issued for usage of third-party programs to gain an unfair advantage, usage of banned Game Modifications, Map Exploits or Game Mechanic Exploits, or outlier cheating cases that do not uphold the spirit of competitive play and sportsmanship within ozfortress.

    Previously, we have had lower ban durations for those using Banned Game Modifications, Map or Game Mechanic Exploits, however we have changed our policy on this. From Season 42 of Sixes/Season 9 of Highlander onward, these breaches will be treated as Unfair Play Bans, and will incur the full penalty listed below.

### VAC Bans

Valve Anti-Cheat bans. These ban types in ozfortress typically mean we have no conclusive evidence of cheating in TF2 or our league, but they were banned by Valve Anti-Cheat for one reason or another. Entering a VAC Secured TF2 server with an administrator can revoke this ban. Contact us via direct messaging [@Alfred in our discord](https://discord.gg/7E6kC2H), or using [#admin-support to open a ticket via Alfred](https://discord.gg/7E6kC2H), so we can schedule a time for you to join a server with a staff member to prove your VAC ban is not for TF2. 

Players with these bans are typically inactive and/or were unable to prove their VAC ban did not originate from TF2.
